Art Routes is a WordPress plugin that allows a WordPress dashboard user to configure routes with points of interest (artworks) on a map.

The plugin uses Leaflet.js (loaded from a CDN) in combination with OpenStreetMap to display the map and the routes.

The plugin is designed to be used by organizations that organize art routes / events, such as Woest & Bijster in the Netherlands, and want to display them on their website.

Please refer to README.md for more information about the specific features of the plugin and how to use them.

Whenever you make changes to the plugin, make sure to update the version number in the main plugin file (`wp-art-routes.php`) and the `README.md` file.
